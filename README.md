📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction using patient health data can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project builds a classification model trained on medical attributes and deploys it as a user-friendly web app.

The project includes:

◻ Data preprocessing

◻ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

◻ Feature selection

◻ Model training

◻ Model evaluation

◻ Model saving (pickle/joblib)

◻ Web app deployment

🔸 Age — Age of the patient

🔸 Sex — Gender

🔸 Chest Pain Type — Type of chest discomfort

🔸 Resting Blood Pressure — BP level

🔸 Cholesterol — Serum cholesterol

🔸 Fasting Blood Sugar — Blood sugar level

🔸 Resting ECG — Heart electrical activity

🔸 Max Heart Rate — Maximum heart rate achieved

🔸 Exercise Induced Angina — Chest pain during exercise

🔸 ST Depression — ST segment depression value

🔸 Slope — Slope of ST segment

🔸 Number of Major Vessels — Colored by fluoroscopy
